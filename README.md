## About the game

"On a quiet serene evening the Cosmic Space Patrol sets out for the usual night cruise through the boulevards of space. [...] but suddenly the Cosmic Space Patrol find themselves surrounded by thousands of the deadly asteroids. The Cosmic Space Patrol must act quickly to save their spacecraft and spare their lives" (*Asteroids Game Program Instructions*, 1979).

Alteroids is a little project to work on code componentization. It results in a multimode (16 modes for the moment) remake of Asteroids in the line of [Pippin Barr's BREAKSOUT](https://www.pippinbarr.com/2015/10/01/breaksout/). Coded in Unity, for the graphics I've used Adobe Illustrator and for the SFXs Bfxr.
